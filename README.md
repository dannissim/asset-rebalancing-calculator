<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Suppose you have a self-managed portfolio, and each month you add a portion of your income to your portfolio.
Suppose as well that you have a target asset allocation. For example:  
| Asset | Target Allocation |
|-------|-------------------|
| VTI   | 64%               |
| VXUS  | 16%               |
| BND   | 20%               |
Using this app you will know how much of each asset to invest in order to be as close as possible 
to your target allocation - without selling any of your current assets.

   2. `deposit_amount` - how many dollars you are adding to your portfolio
   3. `current_market_value` - what your portfolio 
2. Add your stock list and contact info to `config.json`.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional):  
    a. `python -m venv venv`  
    b. `venv\Scripts\activate` or in linux `source venv/bin/activate`
4. install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run `python main.py`

### What does it do?
[//]: # (TODO)
This app checks your list of stocks to see if a price has dropped significatly lower  
than its 200 day simple moving average a.k.a [SMA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp).  
When a stock price passes the threshold, you will receive an email that will notify you.
